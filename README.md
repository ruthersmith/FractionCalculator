# FractionCalculator
My Implimentation of a Fraction calculator
This project is designed to help you practice building your own object class and testing it with a client class. 
You will be creating two classes, one called Fraction and the other called FractionCalculator. 
The Fraction class is an object that holds information about a fraction (numerator and denominator). 
It will have several constructors and both private and public methods implementing the behavior of a fraction. 
The FractionCalculator class is a class that will allow the user to enter in fractions and operations, 
calculating and displaying the result. It will run until the user tells it to quit. When this program is complete, 
you wonâ€™t have to second guess your fraction arithmetic ever again!
